Temporary way to develop against ezpublish while keeping the codebase
separate for easy updates...

Most of this should be migrated to Composer.

The var directory is symlinked to one level above this directory.

The reason is that we prefer .gitignoring of only disposable objects, not
the actual content data in ezpublish/var... 

Should help prevent loosing data in var by not implying they are tracked.
